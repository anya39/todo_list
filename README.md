My project is a to-do list made using Python and primarily the Tkinter library for GUI components. It features add task, delete task, clear completed, clear all, and complete task buttons. I chose to make this project to further practice using the Tkinter library after introducing myself to it in my last small project. I made it by using skills from YouTube videos/tutorials and googling any questions I had! I struggled a little bit with the formatting, I started by using .pack for formatting and had to switch to .grid to achieve the layout I was aiming for. I had trouble understanding how .grid worked at first (because I was using more buttons and components than my last project), but finally got it after trial and error (and some research). I learned more about using the Tkinter library and formatting through this project.
